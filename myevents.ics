DESCRIPTION:Hi friends!\n\nMe and my wife have moved in for some months and we have been working a bit on the house and finally now the project is over. We would like YOU to join us and celebrate it!\n\nSweden in November is getting dark and cold. Let's have a warm party together!\n\nThe recommended way of getting here is to take the commute train towards Kungsbacka and get off at Lindome station. From there you could take a bus 761 or 763 and get off at Lundvägen then you will be 2 minute-walk away.\n\nIf you drive here\, you could park your car on the street around our house.\n\nGifts are not necessary we will be glad enough that YOU come. We will prepare some snacks and soft drinks for all.\n\nNote: We have Lilou home so if you are\, in any way\, allergy to cats\, please let us know before hand.\n\nOur contacts:\nMing: 0704214260\nShunshn: 0723299098\nLilou: miao miao miao =)
